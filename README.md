# Coaching Question Generator

- Web app to generate coaching questions at random.
- Not built using a follow along tutorial.

## Tech Used

- React.js.
- JavaScript.
- Twitter share.
- Netlify.

## Features

- Displays a random question from a list each click.
- Questions do not repeat until all have been used.
- Copy to clipboard - so users can use the question elsewhere or to make a note.
- Tweet - Opens up a new compose tweet (if/when user is logged into Twitter) with the question and a link to the app.

## What I learned

- The importance of project planning and high level architecture.
- Debugging and errors - what do do if the code doesn't work.
- Knowing when to give up and ask = use time efficiently.
- How to consume and delve into/cherry pick the collected data.
- React hooks.
- Knowing that even if you aren't solving the issue, you are still learning along the way.
- Great Git practice.
- Been cool to do a second project without using or referencing another (one that does what i need to do on YouTube in full = the easy way of completing the task).

## Challenges

- Understanding Stack Overflow potential solutions then refactoring into my code context.
- The mental game. I got very frustrated and somewhat depressed during this project.
- Twitter share injecting as an iframe.
- Redraw and not storing state so used hooks to move state elsewhere.
- Working with arrays - getting questions to not repeat whilst on random.
- Understanding how builds work and when to do them.

## Improvements

- Previous question(s) - if they click generate and want to go back.
- Generate a list of questions they had (for future use).
- Have question list hosted in a free database somewhere and fetch/interact from there (option/link for them to access all the qs too).
- Light dark mode toggle.
- Redo using material UI.
- Spacebar or enter to generate.
- Accessibility test and tweaks.
